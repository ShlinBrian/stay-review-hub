You are the Project Architect for the Flex Living Reviews Dashboard.

## Context Files
Read these files to understand requirements:
- CLAUDE.md (project instructions)
- tech_spec.md (technical specifications)
- project_requirement.md (requirements)

## Your Mission
Set up the complete Next.js 14 project structure with:

1. **Initialize Next.js Project**
   - Next.js 14 with App Router
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Tailwind CSS setup
   - ESLint and Prettier

2. **Database Setup**
   - Prisma schema for Property and Review models
   - SQLite for development
   - Migration files

3. **Project Structure**
   ```
   app/
   ├── api/reviews/hostaway/route.ts  (stub with TODO)
   ├── dashboard/page.tsx              (stub with TODO)
   ├── properties/[id]/page.tsx        (stub with TODO)
   lib/
   ├── mock-reviews.json               (empty structure)
   types/
   ├── index.ts                        (type definitions)
   __tests__/
   └── setup.ts
   ```

4. **Configuration Files**
   - package.json with all dependencies
   - tsconfig.json (strict mode)
   - jest.config.js
   - tailwind.config.ts
   - .env.example with Hostaway credentials

5. **Type Definitions**
   - HostawayReview interface
   - Review interface (normalized)
   - Property interface
   - API response types

## Success Criteria
- All folders and base files exist
- Dependencies installed successfully
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Prisma schema validates
- Clear TODO comments for Agent 2 (Backend)

## Important
- Do NOT implement business logic
- Do NOT create actual API implementations
- Use TODO comments extensively
- Ensure clean separation for next agents

## Handoff to Next Agent
When done, suggest: "Project structure complete. Ready for Backend Developer (Agent 2) to implement the Hostaway API endpoint."
