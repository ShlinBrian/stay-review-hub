## Google Reviews Integration Research

**Feasibility:** Medium
**Recommendation:** Viable for complementing Hostaway reviews

**Key Findings:**
- **Cost:** $24 per 1,000 requests (Atmosphere tier for reviews)
- **Free Tier:** $200/month credit = ~8,300 requests
- **For Flex Living:** 150 requests/month = $0.36 (well within free tier)
- **Limitation:** Only 5 reviews per property per request
- **Implementation Time:** 3.5-4.5 hours
- **Requirements:** Google Cloud account with billing enabled

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `/api/reviews/google` endpoint
- Use Place Details API with field mask
- Normalize Google reviews to internal format
- Merge with Hostaway reviews in dashboard
- Add "Google" channel filter

**Challenges Identified:**
1. Limited to 5 reviews per property
2. No category breakdowns (only overall rating)
3. Requires billing account setup
4. No real-time updates (polling required)
5. Place ID management needed

**Conclusion:** Technically straightforward, low cost, but limited review count. Best used as complement to Hostaway for additional social proof.

## Known Behaviors (By Design)

### Hostaway API
- **Sandbox returns 403:** Expected behavior, application gracefully falls back to mock data
- **No live data:** Mock data provides realistic, comprehensive test dataset
- **Logged behavior:** Console logs show API attempt and fallback for transparency

### Mock Data
- **22 reviews:** Distributed across 5 properties
- **Realistic content:** Names, ratings, dates, categories based on actual review patterns
- **Variety:** Different ratings (5-10), review types, dates (Aug-Sept 2025)

### Review Selection
- **Default: Not displayed:** All reviews start with `displayOnWebsite = false`
- **Manager control:** Checkbox toggles approval status
- **Persists:** Database updated via Server Actions
- **Optimistic UI:** Instant visual feedback before database confirms

---

## Design Highlights

### 1. Mock Data Fallback Strategy
**Problem:** Hostaway sandbox returns no data
**Solution:** Try API first, fallback to mock data gracefully
**Benefit:** Fully functional app regardless of API availability

### 2. Data Normalization Layer
**Problem:** External APIs have different formats
**Solution:** Transform all data to consistent internal Review type
**Benefit:** Easy to add new review sources (Google, Airbnb)

### 3. Server Components First
**Problem:** Too much client-side JavaScript
**Solution:** Fetch data in Server Components, pass to Client Components
**Benefit:** Better performance, SEO, and user experience

### 4. Optimistic UI Updates
**Problem:** Database writes feel slow
**Solution:** Update UI immediately, sync to database asynchronously
**Benefit:** Instant feedback, better perceived performance

### 5. SQLite with PostgreSQL Path
**Problem:** Database setup complexity
**Solution:** SQLite for development, Prisma makes PostgreSQL switch trivial
**Benefit:** Zero config locally, production-ready architecture
